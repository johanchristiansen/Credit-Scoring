# Credit Scoring Model

## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to assist financial institutions in making informed decisions regarding loan applications. The model predicts whether a new loan application should be approved or rejected based on the applicant's risk profile.

## Business Problem
Financial institutions face the challenge of balancing loan approvals to maximize profitability while minimizing credit risk. The central question addressed by this project is: *How can we select which customers to accept for loan applications to maintain a low level of risk?*

## Business Objective
The objective of this model is to reduce credit losses and enhance market competitiveness by accurately predicting loan defaults. This enables financial institutions to approve loan applications with confidence, reducing the incidence of bad debts and improving customer relationships.

## Model Insights
- **Accuracy**: Indicates the overall effectiveness of the model in predicting loan defaults, crucial when the dataset is balanced.
- **Precision**: Highlights the model's ability to minimize false positives, which is vital for not denying loans to potentially good customers.
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Shows the model's capability to identify most actual defaults, essential for preventing significant financial losses.
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**: Reflects the model's ability to distinguish between defaulters and non-defaulters across different thresholds.

## Key Metrics
- **Accuracy**: 98%
- **Precision**: 99%
- **Recall**: 98%
- **AUC**: 99.7%

These metrics suggest that the model is highly effective at predicting defaults, which can substantially reduce the risk of credit loss and improve decision-making processes.

## Conclusions
- **Credit Loss Reduction**: High recall rates enable the identification of most defaulters, potentially leading to significant reductions in credit losses.
- **Market Competitiveness**: High precision ensures fewer wrongful loan denials, enhancing customer satisfaction and retention and positioning the company as a fair and reliable lender.

## Repository Content
